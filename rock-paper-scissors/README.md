### Rock, Paper, Scissors

These are projects that are based on Tech with Tim's Python Course.
This the third project.

##### Usage

Run the python file with,

```
python rock-paper-scissors.py
```
Answer the question with either 'rock', 'paper', 'scissors' or 'q' to quit. Other answers may quit the program.

When you answer with either 'rock', 'paper' or 'scissors', the computer also will generate randomly either 'rock', 'paper' or 'scissors' as a value. After comparing the two answers, the winning will be decided. After pressing 'q' to quit, you can see the winnings.
