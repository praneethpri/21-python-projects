### Number Guesser

This is the second project in the Tech with Tim's python projects.

##### Usage

Run the python file with,

```
python number-guesser.py
```

Answer the first question with a positive number. Anything else may quit the program.

After typing the initial number a random number will be generated between 0 and your typed number.

You wouldn't see the randomly generated number. You can guess the number in the second prompt.

If your guess is above or below the number you will get a clue.
After guessing the correct number you can see how may guesses it took you to get the correct number.
